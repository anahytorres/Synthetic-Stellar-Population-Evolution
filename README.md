# Synthetic-Stellar-Population-Evolution
A lightweight Monte Carlo framework to generate a synthetic stellar population, evolve it over 10 Gyr, and classify compact remnants (WD/NS/BH) using literature IFMRs. Includes IMF sampling, simple lifetime modeling, probabilistic channel handling, and ready-made plots for exploring the initial–final mass landscape.
